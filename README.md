# STL Volume Model Calculator

A easy-to-use command-line tool to calculate the volume, surface area, bounding box, and mass of 3D STL models. It provides a comprehensive analysis by default and supports STL (ASCII and binary), NIfTI, and DICOM formats.

## Key Features

-   **Comprehensive Analysis by Default**: Run it with just a filename to get file size, triangle count, bounding box, surface area, and volume.
-   **Full Mass Estimation**: Automatically calculates the estimated mass for over 20 common and specialized 3D printing materials in one go.
-   **Rich Console Output**: Presents data in beautifully formatted and easy-to-read tables.
-   **JSON Output**: Supports JSON output for easy integration with other scripts and applications.
-   **Optimized Calculations**: Option to run specific, single calculations for faster results in automated workflows.
-   **Broad File Support**: Handles binary and ASCII STL files, as well as medical imaging formats like NIfTI and DICOM.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/) installed. You can then install the tool directly from the source code.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mcanet/STL-Volume-Model-Calculator.git
    cd STL-Volume-Model-Calculator
    ```
2.  **Install the package:**
    This command uses the `setup.py` file to handle all dependencies and install the `volume-calculator` command in your system.
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the `volume-calculator` command from any directory.

### Default Full Analysis

This is the recommended and most common use case. Simply provide the path to your model.

```bash
volume-calculator YourModel.stl
```

## Command-Line Arguments

| Argument           | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filename`         | Path to your model file (STL, NIfTI, DICOM).                                 |
| `--calculation`    | (Optional) Optimize by running a single calculation: `volume` or `area`.     |
| `--material <ID>`  | (Optional) Use with `--calculation volume` to specify a material ID.         |
| `--unit <unit>`    | (Optional) Display volume in `cm` (default) or `inch`.                       |
| `--output-format`  | (Optional) Choose output format: `table` (default) or `json`.                |
| `--list-materials` | Display a table of all available materials and their IDs, then exit.         |
